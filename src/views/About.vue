        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I am an experienced web designer, developer, and game developer with a strong background in IT and extensive experience in various projects. Currently, I am studying software development in vocational school as a second-year student. I have been involved in development and programming for six years, which has provided me with comprehensive skills and knowledge in this field.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Motivation and Goals</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          My primary motivation comes from knowing that my work helps others—whether it’s clients needing quality solutions or projects aimed at achieving something meaningful. I feel satisfied when I successfully complete a project, especially when the results exceed expectations. In terms of goals, I aim to become an even more professional and skilled developer and to create increasingly complex and innovative solutions in the future.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Work Ethic and Values</h4>

        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Strengths and Weaknesses</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          My biggest strengths are my ability to understand and write code, as well as my quick learning ability. Most of my knowledge and skills were acquired independently before I began formal studies. However, I still have room to grow in areas like creating animations and working with PHP.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Hobbies and Free Time</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          In my free time, I enjoy engaging in active and creative hobbies. I play computer games like Rust, DayZ, Squad, Minecraft, FiveM, RDR2, and GTA5. I also enjoy spending time outdoors, playing airsoft, and cycling. These activities help me maintain a balance between work and leisure.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Studies and Professional Development</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
          I am currently studying software development in vocational school, which complements my existing knowledge. I encounter code daily, both at school and at home, as programming is my greatest passion and a lifestyle.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-3">Collaboration and Creativity</h4>
        <p class="text-gray-400 leading-relaxed mb-6">
